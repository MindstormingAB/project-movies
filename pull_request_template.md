My reflections on how this week's project turned out: It has been fun and challenging to enter deeply into APIs, components and React state and start developing multi-page applications.

Things I'd like to have clarified or explained in more detail: I'd like to understand where to put `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` in order to get rid of the warning message 'React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency'.
